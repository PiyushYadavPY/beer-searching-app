# beer-searching-app
Welcome to BeersByName, a web application that allows users to search and filter beers by various parameters. This application utilizes JavaScript to enable dynamic filtering and display of beer information.

The application uses JavaScript to enable the dynamic behavior of the web page, including fetching beer data from an external API, filtering beers based on user interactions, and displaying beer information.

Fetching Beer Data:

The FetchBeerData function fetches beer data from the Punk API using a specified API endpoint and updates the page with the retrieved beer information.

Searching Beers by Name:

Users can search for beers by their names using the search input. The filterBeerName function filters the beers based on the provided search term.

Filtering Beers:

Users can filter beers by attenuation level using the "Greater Than," "Lower Than," or "None" buttons. The filterByAttenuation function filters the beers accordingly.
Users can also filter by pH and SRM using checkboxes and sliders. The filterByPH and filterBySRM functions handle these filters.

Pagination:

The pagination feature allows users to navigate through different pages of beers using the "Prev" and "Next" buttons.
